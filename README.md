# movie-ticket-management
Most of world is running behind the Entertainment and in the
present world we need every thing to be at the tip of our
fingers.
Our basic idea of the project is to create an interface
between the user and the movie theatres. This makes the
process of ticket booking much simpler.
It takes few minutes to book a movie ticket on online rather
waiting in queue for so long time. The customers can make
their ticket booking at any instance of 24 hours a day.
This project mainly consists of the following operations: -
 Booking a ticket of user’s choice of theatre and movie.
 Displaying the review of the movie
